These screenshots are my follow-through of practice using AWS CodeDeploy.

Since I cannot share them any other way, I am using screenshots.



Some of the steps I followed

- Created the neccessary IAM roles & policies to allow for the deployment
- Provisioned a t2.medium instance
- Installed CodeDeploy agent on the ec2 instance.
- Code was uploaded to s3, then deployed from there.
